  <h1>My Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>
    Design is an alternative to dealing with words. Design materializes one's thoughts into something flat or three-dimensional through one's work and then conveys it to others. Design is a kind of abstract communication. People can feel my thoughts from my design works. My works can also tell them what kind of person I am. Design is an indirect, imaginative way of communicating. To be specific, when I create fashion works, my inspiration comes from my perception of life. For example, there was a project that I was inspired by, which reported on suicides in the news. Many people were standing around the building, watching the distraught person jump off the building. Some people even took pictures with their mobile phones. Others heckled the jumper. Their words and actions are like invisible pressure, urging the jumper to take his own life. I think they have no respect for <a class="red" href="https://www.pinterest.com/" >life</a>. Therefore, in costume creation, I show my dissatisfaction with the spectators and my sympathy for the jumper. My design creation serves to warn the observers. I hope when people see my work, they will know not to make a fool of themselves and laughing is socially inappropriate. In fact, in life design is everywhere. We use design with food. It is in the plating and appetizing appeal. <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/" target="_blank">Similarly</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">we</a> see design in garments we wear. Fabric can be ornate and beautiful. Clothing can also be functional and practical. Oddly enough, some design works have been reported to <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">help</a> others through Art Therapy. I read that sculpture is used to help some autistic children by teaching them about love. Therefore, our life cannot be without design.
